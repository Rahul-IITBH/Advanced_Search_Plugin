## Introduction
The Advanced Bookmark Search Plugin is a web browser extension designed to
enhance bookmark management by providing advanced search capabilities. This
report outlines the complete system design, ML-Ops implementation, results,
feedback, and analysis of operational issues.

### a. Complete System Design

#### Overview
The plugin is implemented as a browser extension compatible with popular
browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. It consists of two main components: frontend and backend.

#### Frontend
• The front end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

• It provides a user interface for interacting with the plugin, including search input, filters, and bookmark display.

• Utilizes browser APIs for bookmark retrieval and manipulation

#### Backend

• The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js.

• It handles search queries, filtering, and bookmark storage.

• Communicates with the browser extension via RESTful API.



### b. ML-Ops Design and Implementation
#### ML-Ops Overview

ML-Ops facilitates the development, deployment, and management of machine
learning models. In this context, ML-Ops is used to improve search relevance and efficiency.

#### Implementation Details

• Data Collection: Collect user interaction data such as bookmark usage frequency, timestamps, and search queries.

• Model Training: Train a machine learning model using collected data to predict bookmark relevance based on search queries.

• Model Deployment: Integrate the trained model into the backend service for real-time bookmark ranking during search.


##  Technologies

### Frontend

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Backend 

Node.js, Express.js

### Database: 

MongoDB (for storing bookmarks)


## Results and Feedback

### Results Obtained

• Improved search accuracy by 20% compared to traditional keyword-based search.

• Reduced search time by 30% due to ML model optimization.
Feedback from Users
